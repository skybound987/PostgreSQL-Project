# PostgreSQL-Project
A set of scripts for PostgreSQL that query a film database by extracting data and creating table joins by field type.  Two tables, detailed_table and summary_table, are created and populated.  The detailed_table includes comprehensive rental data, while the summary_table aggregates rental counts by film category.
